	Welcome to my journey in the tech world! You can expect Linux, servers, android, hardware or whatever I find interesting and learning at the time.

Why does everything look so simplistic? Well, I believe the web is bloated, many sites rely heavily on scripts and images, making the web slow and unresponsive.

I will manly focus on GNU/Linux and free and open software, as it's something I feel passionate about. I find command lines and terminals fascinating, it allows us to easily automate tasks you would take far to long with a graphical user interface.

Topics I wan't to cover range from programs like Vim, Ranger and Cmus. Linux Distributions like Manjaro or Ubuntu and even different operating systems entirely.
